IF YOU DO NOT USE SETPLAYERLOOKAT, THEN PLAYER ROTATION DOES NOT DIRECTION TO THE X, Y COORDINATE YOU SET

# NOTE

```bash
THIS INCLUDE ONLY USES X, Y COORDINATES AND THIS INCLUDE IS STILL BETA TEST, IF THERE ARE BUG PLEASE UNDERSTAND
```

```
MAYBE IN THE NEXT UPDATE I'LL ADD Z COORDINATES, IF YOU HAVE ANGLE PROBLEMS YOU CAN USE SetPlayerAngle Temporarily
```

# EXAMPLE SCRIPT

```js
CMD:tes(playerid, params[])
{
	SetPlayerLookAt(playerid, 285.5169, -40.0603);
	return 1;
}
```
// SECTION 285.5169, -40.0603 You change to X, Y from your coordinates

THANKS, IF IT'S NOT CLEAR, IT'S OKAY TO UNDERSTAND IT FOR YOURSELF
